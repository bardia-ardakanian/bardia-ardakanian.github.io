Hi! I'm Bardia Ardakanian, a Computer Engineering graduate from [Amirkabir University of Technology](https://aut.ac.ir/en) in Iran. I completed my degree in September 2024 under the supervision of [Dr. Mahdi Javanmardi](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://jp.linkedin.com/in/mjavan&ved=2ahUKEwivqbq__KmJAxWDh_0HHagTF4QQFnoECB0QAQ&usg=AOvVaw2gX66C-fxUGoidIBMsOqhG). Over the past year and a half, I have contributed to both the Robotics Lab, supervised by Dr. Javanmardi, and the Hardware Lab under Dr. Hamed Farbeh, where I focused on advancing projects in robotics, computer vision, and hardware optimization.

Since then, I have been actively exploring my passion in:

Alongside my academic pursuits, I bring three years of industry experience, working as a Machine Learning Engineer since September 2022 on robotic control systems for packaging and sorting in food chain automation. Previously, I spent a year and a half as a software developer in top Iranian industries.
