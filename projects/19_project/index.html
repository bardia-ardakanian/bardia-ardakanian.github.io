The project involved building my own custom game engine to handle gameplay mechanics, physics, and interactions, making it a foundational step in my journey as a game developer.</p> <h3 id="game-design-and-features">Game Design and Features</h3> <p>The game allows multiplayer tank battles in a maze-like environment, where players navigate, strategize, and compete. Key features include:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Custom Physics Engine:</strong> <ul> <li>Realistic projectile physics, including bouncing bullets and accurate collision detection.</li> <li>Damage mechanics that slow tanks down as they take hits.</li> <li>Fully destructible walls, where bullets create cracks or destroy sections entirely.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>Engaging Gameplay:</strong> <ul> <li>Multiplayer mode for two players to battle strategically in a dynamic maze.</li> <li>Single-player mode with an AI opponent, featuring simple decision-making algorithms to track and attack the player.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>Immersive Details:</strong> <ul> <li>Real-time effects such as explosions and visual indicators for tank damage.</li> <li>Dynamic health representation for tanks, reflecting damage in real-time.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id="highlights">Highlights</h3> <ul> <li>Built a custom Java game engine capable of handling complex physics-based interactions.</li> <li>Designed and implemented features like bouncing bullets, destructible environments, and real-time damage effects.</li> <li>Developed both multiplayer and AI-powered single-player gameplay.</li> <li>This project was a significant milestone in learning game development fundamentals, from physics programming to interactive design.</li> </ul> <p><a href="https://github.com/bardia-ardakanian/CE104-AP-TankTrouble" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GitHub Repository</a></p> </body></html>
