  abstract={In recent years, the integration of multisensory data such as camera and LiDAR in object detection systems has garnered significant attention. This integration can help improve accuracy and efficiency in object recognition. However, the collection and manual labeling of data required to train object detection models is a time-consuming and costly process. In this research, we evaluate the performance of a proposed method for region proposal using unsupervised learning and the fusion of camera and LiDAR data. The main objective is to determine how this approach can be effective in the region proposal process and how it affects the accuracy and speed of object detection. To this end, two-dimensional camera images and three-dimensional LiDAR data are fused, and unsupervised clustering algorithms are employed to identify regions containing objects. The results indicate that this method can detect object-containing regions with acceptable accuracy without the need for labeled data, which can help reduce the costs and time required for developing object detection systems.},
