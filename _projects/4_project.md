The **Cup Conveyor System** was designed to optimize product transportation within the production line, integrating **robotic automation** for precise and damage-free handling.

### Key Contributions

- **Gentle Robotic Handling:**
  - Engineered cup designs to secure delicate products like eggs during transportation.
  - Reduced the risk of damage through **motion control algorithms** for smooth operations.

- **AI-Powered Logistics:**
  - Implemented **logistic optimization models** to minimize downtime and improve throughput.
  - Ensured seamless coordination between upstream and downstream systems.

### Impact

- Reduced handling errors, contributing to a **28% cost reduction** in operational logistics.
- Played a critical role in meeting production demands and facilitating export operations.
