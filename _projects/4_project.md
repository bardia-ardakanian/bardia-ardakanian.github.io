The **Cup Conveyor System** was designed to optimize product transportation within the production line by integrating **motion control and intelligent logistics** for precise and damage-free handling.

### Key Contributions

- **Gentle Handling Mechanism:**
  - Engineered cup designs to securely transport delicate products, such as eggs, during movement within the production line.
  - Minimized the risk of damage using **advanced motion control algorithms** for smooth and consistent operations.

- **AI-Powered Logistics:**
  - Developed **logistic optimization models** to reduce downtime and improve throughput efficiency.
  - Ensured seamless integration and coordination with upstream and downstream production systems.

### Impact

- Reduced handling errors and contributed to a **28% cost reduction** in operational logistics.
- Improved production line efficiency, supporting increased output and reliable export operations.
