Simulated an **airplane emergency control system** using the **Proteus** simulator and **ATMega16 microcontroller**, focusing on real-time control and disaster response mechanisms. The project involved programming the microcontroller in assembly language to handle emergency scenarios effectively. This project was for the **Microprocessor Systems** course, where we learned about embedded systems, real-time control, and hardware programming.

The simulation begins with a **pressure drop** in various parts of the airplane, including the **pilot cabin** and **passenger cabin**, mimicking a critical emergency situation. Sensors measure the pressure levels in real time, and a system of motors is activated to stabilize the pressure. The motors dynamically adjust to restore normal pressure conditions in all sections of the airplane. Once the pressure is stabilized, the system automatically stops the motors, ensuring energy efficiency and safety.

This project provided hands-on experience in **hardware-level programming**, real-time system monitoring, and designing control systems capable of responding to simulated emergencies.
