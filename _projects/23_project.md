**Nudles** is a 2D puzzle game developed during the Amirkabir GameCraft 2022 Game Jam, where it secured **2nd place**. The game revolves around a unique gameplay mechanic: players must manage their character’s size and weight to interact with a cat, Nudles, in a grid-based environment. By adjusting the player's size, they can manipulate the cat's position while navigating obstacles and solving puzzles. The primary challenge lies in moving Nudles, a playful yet stubborn cat, across the board. Nudles can either be **fat or thin**, requiring players to carefully balance their character's weight to match or exceed the cat's weight. Strategic planning is crucial, as the game introduces barriers and constraints, such as weight limits or movement restrictions, that add depth to the puzzles.

The cat, Nudles, reacts dynamically to the player’s actions, making the gameplay both engaging and rewarding. If the player’s weight is insufficient, Nudles refuses to move. If the weight is properly adjusted, the cat moves, enabling progress through the levels. When Nudles reaches its bed, it triggers a sleeping animation, marking the level’s completion. The game also features detailed visual elements, such as a blinking animation for Nudles, which adds personality to the character. Each level introduces new obstacles, including paths that restrict growth or movement, encouraging players to think strategically to solve the puzzles.
