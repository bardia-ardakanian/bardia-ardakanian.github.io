This project involved creating a search engine using the **inverted index technique** to index and retrieve content efficiently. The dataset consisted of 25,000 news articles in Farsi, with some parts in English. Handling the **bidirectional text** was particularly challenging due to Farsi’s right-to-left orientation and English’s left-to-right structure. **Tokenization** required careful design to ensure accuracy, but the system achieved high performance, processing queries and ranking results in under 0.3 seconds.

The search engine delivered results with **90% recall and precision**, demonstrating its effectiveness in content retrieval. Multiple similarity functions were implemented to compare their impact on ranking quality. This project, developed for an **Information Retrieval** course, provided a comprehensive understanding of retrieval systems and performance evaluation.
