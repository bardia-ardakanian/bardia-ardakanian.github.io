This project involved implementing various **Fourier Transforms** in Python, including **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)**, **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**, and **Continuous Fourier Transform (CFT)**. These implementations provided a practical understanding of signal processing concepts and their applications in fields like audio analysis, image processing, and systems engineering.

### Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)

The **DFT** computes the frequency domain representation of a discrete signal. In Python, this can be achieved by summing the contributions of sinusoidal components at various frequencies. Each component is computed by taking the product of the signal values and a complex exponential term, iterating over all combinations of frequencies and signal samples. While straightforward to implement, the DFT has a high computational cost, making it suitable for small datasets or educational purposes.

### Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)

The **FFT** is an optimized algorithm for computing the DFT, significantly reducing the number of computations by using a divide-and-conquer approach. In Python, FFT algorithms split the signal into smaller parts, recursively applying the DFT to these parts and then combining the results. Libraries like NumPy provide highly efficient FFT implementations, making it the preferred method for analyzing large datasets in real-world applications.

### Continuous Fourier Transform (CFT)

The **CFT** is used to analyze continuous signals, transforming them into their frequency domain representation. While Python cannot directly handle continuous signals, the CFT can be approximated by numerically integrating the product of the signal and a complex exponential over a defined range. This approach is commonly applied to synthetic signals or mathematical models to simulate CFT behavior and study its properties.

These implementations in Python provided a hands-on exploration of how Fourier Transforms work and their significance in various fields, bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and practical applications.
