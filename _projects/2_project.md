I developed an **AI-powered sorting and candling system** to automate quality control processes by leveraging computer vision and machine learning for precision inspection and categorization.

### Key Contributions

- **Candling Using Machine Vision:**
  - Designed a system to identify internal defects, such as cracks, using **computer vision algorithms**.
  - Leveraged **real-time imaging** to enable rapid and accurate quality assessment.

- **Intelligent Sorting:**
  - Implemented **deep learning models** to classify items based on quality attributes.
  - Integrated feedback loops to continuously optimize sorting decisions and improve efficiency.

### Impact

- Reduced dependency on manual inspection, significantly improving accuracy and reliability.
- Enabled **real-time sorting for a 17-ton daily output**, streamlining production processes.
- Elevated quality standards for both local and international markets, ensuring compliance with stringent regulations.
