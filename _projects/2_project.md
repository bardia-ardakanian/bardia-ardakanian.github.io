I developed an **AI-powered sorting and candling system** to automate quality control processes, leveraging **computer vision** and robotics for precision inspection and categorization.

### Key Contributions

- **Candling Using Machine Vision:**
  - Designed a system to identify internal defects, such as cracks, using **computer vision algorithms**.
  - Leveraged **real-time imaging** to achieve rapid and accurate quality assessment.

- **Intelligent Sorting:**
  - Implemented robotic arms programmed with **deep learning models** to differentiate between cracked and uncracked items.
  - Integrated feedback loops to optimize sorting decisions over time.

### Impact

- Reduced dependency on manual inspection, improving accuracy and reliability.
- Enhanced productivity, enabling **real-time sorting for a 17-ton daily output**.
- Elevated quality standards for both local and international markets.
