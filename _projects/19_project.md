**Tank Trouble** is the first video game I developed, designed entirely from scratch in Java. The project involved building my own custom game engine to handle gameplay mechanics, physics, and interactions, making it a foundational step in my journey as a game developer.

### Game Design and Features

The game allows multiplayer tank battles in a maze-like environment, where players navigate, strategize, and compete. Key features include:

- **Custom Physics Engine:**
  - Realistic projectile physics, including bouncing bullets and accurate collision detection.
  - Damage mechanics that slow tanks down as they take hits.
  - Fully destructible walls, where bullets create cracks or destroy sections entirely.

- **Engaging Gameplay:**
  - Multiplayer mode for two players to battle strategically in a dynamic maze.
  - Single-player mode with an AI opponent, featuring simple decision-making algorithms to track and attack the player.

- **Immersive Details:**
  - Real-time effects such as explosions and visual indicators for tank damage.
  - Dynamic health representation for tanks, reflecting damage in real-time.

### Highlights

- Built a custom Java game engine capable of handling complex physics-based interactions.
- Designed and implemented features like bouncing bullets, destructible environments, and real-time damage effects.
- Developed both multiplayer and AI-powered single-player gameplay.
- This project was a significant milestone in learning game development fundamentals, from physics programming to interactive design.
