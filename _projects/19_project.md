**Tank Trouble** was the first video game I developed, entirely built from scratch in **Java**. This project marked a major milestone in my journey into game development, as I designed and implemented my own **game engine** to handle physics, interactions, and gameplay mechanics. It was an opportunity to learn game design principles and explore the fundamentals of physics simulation for games.

The game features a multiplayer tank battle set in a maze-like environment, where players navigate through the map, dodge obstacles, and strategize their attacks. The **custom physics engine** enabled realistic projectile behavior, such as bullets bouncing off walls with accurate collision detection. Damage mechanics added depth to the gameplay, where tanks slowed down as they took hits. The environment itself was interactive, with destructible walls that could crack or collapse under fire, adding dynamic elements to each match.

In addition to multiplayer mode, I developed a single-player mode featuring an AI opponent. The AI used basic decision-making algorithms to track the player's movements and fire strategically, providing an engaging challenge. The game included immersive details such as explosions, dynamic health indicators for tanks, and real-time effects that enhanced the overall experience. 

This project taught me the essentials of **game design**, from crafting physics-based interactions to implementing engaging gameplay features. It became a cornerstone of my early exploration into games, helping me understand both technical and creative aspects of interactive system design.
