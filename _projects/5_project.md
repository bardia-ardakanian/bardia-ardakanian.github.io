The **Product Aligner** was designed to streamline initial stages of the production line by positioning products accurately for downstream robotic systems. This system represents the foundation of the entire automation workflow.

### Key Contributions

- **Robotics for Alignment:**
  - Developed a high-speed alignment system using **servo motor control** for precision.
  - Ensured compatibility with robotic arms and sorting systems.

- **Machine Learning Integration:**
  - Applied **object detection models** to dynamically adapt alignment based on product size and shape.
  - Enabled real-time feedback loops to reduce alignment errors.

### Impact

- Established the groundwork for a fully automated production line, eliminating bottlenecks.
- Contributed significantly to scaling production capacity from **2.5 tons to 17 tons daily**.
