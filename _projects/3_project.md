To meet diverse market demands, I designed two **automated sorting systems**: one for size-based categorization and another for quality differentiation, both optimized using **AI-driven automation**.

### Key Contributions

- **Size-Based Sorting:**
  - Developed an automated system to classify products into large and small categories using **sensor-based technology**.
  - Integrated predictive models to dynamically adjust sorting thresholds based on real-time production requirements.

- **Integrity-Based Sorting:**
  - Deployed computer vision models to detect structural anomalies, ensuring efficient separation of cracked and uncracked items.
  - Automated downstream packaging processes by linking sorting outcomes to the packaging system.

### Impact

- Boosted the production line's efficiency and scalability from **2.5 tons to 17 tons daily**.
- Enabled diversified packaging strategies for different market segments, including export-quality products.
- Demonstrated the effective application of AI and automation in high-volume manufacturing.
