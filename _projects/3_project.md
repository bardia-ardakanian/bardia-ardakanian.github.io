To handle diverse market demands, I designed two **robotic sorting systems**: one for size-based categorization and another for quality differentiation, both optimized using **automation and AI**.

### Key Contributions

- **Size-Based Sorting:**
  - Implemented a robotic system to classify products into large and small categories using **sensor-based automation**.
  - Integrated predictive models to dynamically adjust sorting thresholds based on production needs.

- **Integrity-Based Sorting:**
  - Deployed **computer vision models** to detect structural anomalies, ensuring cracked and uncracked items are separated efficiently.
  - Automated downstream packaging processes based on sorting outcomes.

### Impact

- Increased the efficiency and scalability of the production line from **2.5 tons to 17 tons daily**.
- Supported diversified packaging strategies for different market segments, including export-quality products.
- Reinforced the role of robotics and AI in high-volume production.
