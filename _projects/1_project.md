As part of the production line overhaul, I developed an **automated product printing system** that uses intelligent control to ensure precise marking of expiration and production dates. This system is a vital component of the manufacturing workflow by enabling high-speed, reliable, and traceable operations.

### Key Contributions

- **Intelligent Control:**
  - Designed a mechanism to synchronize with the conveyor system for real-time printing.
  - Integrated **control algorithms** to detect and correct errors during production.

- **Machine Learning Application:**
  - Utilized **optical character recognition (OCR)** to verify print quality and minimize errors.
  - Improved predictive maintenance by analyzing machine logs to anticipate potential issues.

### Impact

- Eliminated manual errors, ensuring 100% compliance with regulatory standards.
- Supported the **17-ton daily production output** by automating a critical stage of the workflow.
- Enabled seamless international shipping by meeting global traceability standards.
