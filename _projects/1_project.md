As a **Machine Learning Engineer**, I contributed to the development and deployment of **robot control systems** for sorting, packaging, and quality assessment in an industrial setting. This project integrated **robotics**, **automation**, and **machine vision** to enhance operational efficiency while maintaining high product quality.

### Key Contributions
- **Robot Control Systems:**
  - Designed and programmed robotic arms equipped with suction mechanisms for precise and efficient sorting.
  - Integrated control systems with conveyor belts to enable synchronized sorting and packaging operations.

- **Candling Technology:**
  - Implemented **candling techniques** to inspect the internal quality of products like eggs.
  - Enabled non-invasive quality assessment using advanced imaging techniques, ensuring high product standards.

- **System Integration:**
  - Assembled and synchronized a complete packaging line, including conveyor belts, robotic arms, and sorting sections.
  - Optimized system performance to achieve seamless coordination between components.

- **Cost Optimization:**
  - Reduced **operational costs by 10%** through efficient robotic control and system optimization.
  - Improved delivery service efficiency, leading to a **28% reduction in costs**.
  - Conducted business analysis and devised strategies that resulted in a **17% overall cost reduction**.

### Impact
This project demonstrated the effective application of robotics, computer vision, and automation in industrial operations. The integration of **candling for quality control** with synchronized robotic systems significantly improved productivity, reduced manual labor, and ensured product integrity.
