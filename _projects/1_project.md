As part of the production line overhaul, I developed an **automated product printing system** that utilizes robotics and intelligent control to ensure precise marking of expiration and production dates. This machine is an essential component of the production workflow, facilitating high-speed, reliable, and traceable operations.

### Key Contributions

- **Robotics Integration:**
  - Designed a robotic mechanism to synchronize with the conveyor system for real-time printing.
  - Incorporated **intelligent control algorithms** for error detection and correction.

- **Machine Learning Application:**
  - Employed **optical character recognition (OCR)** techniques to verify print quality and reduce errors.
  - Enhanced predictive maintenance through data-driven insights from machine logs.

### Impact

- Eliminated manual errors, ensuring 100% compliance with regulatory standards.
- Contributed to the **17-ton daily production output** by automating a critical stage of the workflow.
- Enabled seamless international shipping by meeting global traceability standards.
