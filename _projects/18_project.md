This project involved designing and simulating a **smart home environment** using **Verilog**, focusing on the practical applications of logic circuits in real-world systems. The goal was to model various automated functionalities commonly found in smart homes, showcasing how hardware-level design can integrate with modern convenience.

### Key Systems Simulated

The smart home system included multiple interconnected modules, each controlling a specific function. For example, the **light control system** monitored light levels in the home and automatically opened curtains or turned on lights if the levels were low. The **temperature control system** adjusted heating or cooling based on the ambient temperature. The **sound management system** controlled device volumes, ensuring consistent and comfortable sound levels across the home. Additionally, other devices such as **lights**, **TV**, and **coffee machines** were programmed to activate based on predefined triggers or schedules, all designed using **Verilog**.
