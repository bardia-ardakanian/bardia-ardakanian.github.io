This project involved designing and implementing a **neural network from scratch** using only **NumPy**, with the goal of classifying the **MNIST dataset** of handwritten digits. The network architecture consists of an input layer, a single hidden layer, and an output layer. Through careful implementation of key components like **forward propagation**, **backpropagation**, **gradient descent**, and **dropout**, the model achieved an impressive 98% accuracy on the classification task.

Every part of the network, including the **activation functions** and the **dropout mechanism**, was manually coded to build a deeper understanding of how these elements contribute to the learning process. Implementing **backpropagation** myself helped me comprehend how gradients are calculated and used to update weights during training. This hands-on experience gave me a solid grasp of neural network mechanics, equipping me with the knowledge to build and analyze more complex models in the future.
