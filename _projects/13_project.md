This project involved designing and implementing an **ad API monetization service** as part of a cloud computing course. The system was built using **Python** and **Django** to handle API requests efficiently and ensure seamless ad management. To support scalability and ease of deployment, the project was containerized using **Docker**, allowing the API to run in distributed environments with minimal setup.

The service featured core functionalities such as tracking API usage, managing ad campaigns, and monitoring performance metrics. It implemented a monetization model where users paid based on API calls, ensuring a clear and scalable revenue system. The project was a hands-on exploration of building production-grade APIs while applying cloud-native technologies for deployment and scaling.
